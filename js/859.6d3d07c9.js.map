My name is Cyril Seberiaga, a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at the \n                        University of San Agustin. I was a Freelance SEO (Search Engine Optimization) in the past but shifted \n                        career to Programming. I am a highly analytical person and likes to solve problems and challenges.</p>\n\n                        <p class=\"my-3 font-weight-regular\">I am currently working as a Computer Programmer in the Province of Guimaras. I create systems that can \n                        help with our Local Government Unit. I created a Financial Assistance Systems (AICS) which is connecting \n                        to 3 departments (Governors Office, PSWDO and Provincial Treasurers Office). The system helps with \n                        managing and checking the Financial Aide grant by the offices. It is still being used 2 years after I have \n                        created it. I have also created a Covid-19 Donation Inventory system and Guimaras Faceshield and Social \n                        Distancing System. I am currently working on a Hospital Inventory and Sales System and Document \n                        Routing and Archiving System.</p>\n\n                        <p class=\"my-3 font-weight-regular\">I am also in-charge of creating custom pages to the official website (Wordpress) of the Province of \n                        Guimaras. I connect different and scattered offices through the use of Point to Point and Nano station \n                        and network it to the server so that every PC that has system that needs to be connected to the server \n                        can communicate with it. I am also in-charge of making sure that the Audio and Video that is needed for \n                        the Live Events (Social Media) and Zoom conference has a clear audio and video. I also create PC and \n                        Laptop specifications to use in the Purchase Request of the Departments so that they can work \n                        productively and not be hassled by the slow response of their PC/Laptop. I also troubleshoot software \n                        and hardware issues my fellow employees.</p>\n\n                        <p class=\"my-3 font-weight-regular\">On my free time, I learn Linux commands and how to navigate and install libraries and plugins on a Linux \n                        Server. I am also learning Python in order to automate task such as filtering, processing and create \n                        reports using CSV files. I am also learning how to use Docker as tool to create a Virtual Machine on my \n                        local laptop/PC in order to avoid library incompatibility for the Systems that I will be creating.\n                        I am currently creating web applications using Laravel, Vue and MySQL to implement on the future plans \n                        of the Province of Guimaras. Everything I have learned, I learned it through self-taught and through \n                        research on Search Engines. I continue to learn new tech and skills after my work to improve my skills. I \n                        am also a team player who is available to help with others if need be.\n                        </p>\n                    </v-card-text>\n                </v-card>\n            </v-col>\n        </v-row>\n    </v-container>\n</template>","import { render } from \"./About.vue?vue&type=template&id=cb7879f8\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementVNode","_createBlock","_component_v_container","_createVNode","_component_v_row","_component_v_col","md","_hoisted_1","_component_v_img","height","cover","src","require","_component_v_card","flat","_component_v_card_text","_hoisted_2","_component_v_divider","_hoisted_3","_hoisted_4","_hoisted_5","_hoisted_6","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
